`Motivation:` The goal of the project was to perform visual analysis for big data based on the vessel AIS tracking system. For more info, check Global Fishing Watch. We wanted to increase awareness about global fishing activities, especially illegal behavior on high seas. Potential areas of discussions included: illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, global fishing patterns based on vessel type and vessel flag; violence and forced labor; ghost fishing and vessel false tracks.
