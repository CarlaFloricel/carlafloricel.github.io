`Motivation:` In the glory days of technology, when Software projects' main concerns are fast data gathering and visualization, the vINCI project develops an integrated platform for the cooperation of different devices used in a non-intrusive observation and health analysis of older adults. Its platform uses 4 types of devices to collect data concerning the physical and psychological health conditions of retired persons, and with the contribution of medical organizations that collaborate to the project, the data is medically validated and available for the elder ones and their families.
			With a well organized microservice architecture and cutting edge technologies, the project provides a unique solution for improving elder people's lives and their families.
