`Abstract:` Aircraft engines emit particulates that alter the chemical composition of the atmosphere and perturb the Earth's radiation budget by creating additional ice clouds in the form of condensation trails called contrails. We propose a multi-scale visual computing system that will assist in defining contrail features with parameter analysis for computer-generated aircraft engine simulations. These simulations are computationally intensive and rely on high performance computing (HPC) solutions. Our multi-linked visual system seeks to help in the identification of the formation and evolution of contrails and in the identification of contrail-related spatial features from the simulation workflow.
