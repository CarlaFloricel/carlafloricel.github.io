I am a [Ph.D. student](https://www.evl.uic.edu/people/2461) at the University of Illinois Chicago in Computer Science, doing research in `Visual Data Science` at the [Electronic Visualization Laboratory](https://www.evl.uic.edu). I finished my Bachelors at the Politehnica University of Bucharest, in Romania.

I am interested in helping people understand complex data through visualization and I enjoy designing novel visualizations for large-scale temporal trends and cohort data. I am focused on designing, developing, and evaluating `Visual Analytics Systems`, primarily for medical data.

My hobbies include [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115467412-carla), traveling, biking, and cooking.
