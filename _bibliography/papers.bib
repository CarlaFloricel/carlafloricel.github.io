  abstract={Approximately 100,000 cases of Head and Neck Cancer (HNC) are diagnosed in the US annually. Patients are increasingly likely to survive, but often experience acute and long term side effects [1]. Hence, great importance has been placed by clinicians on improving patient’s quality of life (QoL) and reducing symptom burden during treatment. We introduce an interactive system which enables clinical and computational experts to visualize and assess medical data. Using novel combinations of visual encodings, our system provides context for new patients based on patients with similar features and symptom evolution, which could help oncologists to create better treatment plans.},

  abstract={Although cancer patients survive years after oncologic therapy, they are plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiotherapy, by further symptom dependency on the tumor location and prescribed treatment. We describe THALIS, an environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our approach leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this approach on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that THALIS supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research.},

  abstract={Cancer patients experience many symptoms throughout their cancer treatment and sometimes
suffer from lasting effects post-treatment. Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) surveys provide a
means for monitoring the patient’s symptoms during and after treatment. Symptom cluster (SC)
research seeks to understand these symptoms and their relationships to define new treatment
and disease management methods to improve patient’s quality of life. This paper introduces
association rule mining (ARM) as a novel alternative for identifying symptom clusters. We
compare the results to prior research and find that while some of the SCs are similar, ARM
uncovers more nuanced relationships between symptoms such as anchor symptoms that serve as
connections between interference and cancer-specific symptoms.},

  abstract={Digital biomarkers (DBMs) are a growing field and increasingly tested in the therapeutic areas of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Meanwhile, isolated silos of knowledge of audiovisual DBMs use in industry, academia, and clinics hinder their widespread adoption in clinical research. How can we help these non-technical domain experts to explore audiovisual digital biomarkers? The use of open source software in biomedical research to extract patient behavior changes is growing and inspiring a shift toward accessibility to address this problem. OpenDBM integrates several popular audio and visual open source behavior extraction toolkits. We present a visual analysis tool as an extension of the growing open source software, OpenDBM, to promote the adoption of audiovisual DBMs in basic and applied research. Our tool illustrates patterns in behavioral data while supporting interactive visual analysis of any subset of derived or raw DBM variables extracted through OpenDBM.}

  abstract={Contrails are condensation trails generated from emitted particles by aircraft engines, which perturb Earth's radiation budget. Simulation modeling is used to interpret the formation and development of contrails. These simulations are computationally intensive and rely on high-performance computing solutions, and the contrail structures are not well defined. We propose a visual computing system to assist in defining contrails and their characteristics, as well as in the analysis of parameters for computer-generated aircraft engine simulations. The back-end of our system leverages a contrail-formation criterion and clustering methods to detect contrails' shape and evolution and identify similar simulation runs. The front-end system helps analyze contrails and their parameters across multiple simulation runs. The evaluation with domain experts shows this approach successfully aids in contrail data investigation.}

  abstract={Personalized head and neck cancer therapeutics have greatly improved survival rates for patients, but are often leading to understudied long-lasting symptoms which affect quality of life. Sequential rule mining (SRM) is a promising unsupervised machine learning method for predicting longitudinal patterns in temporal data which, however, can output many repetitive patterns that are difficult to interpret without the assistance of visual analytics. We present a data-driven, human-machine analysis visual system developed in collaboration with SRM model builders in cancer symptom research, which facilitates mechanistic knowledge discovery in large scale, multivariate cohort symptom data. Our system supports multivariate predictive modeling of post-treatment symptoms based on during-treatment symptoms. It supports this goal through an SRM, clustering, and aggregation back end, and a custom front end to help develop and tune the predictive models. The system also explains the resulting predictions in the context of therapeutic decisions typical in personalized care delivery. We evaluate the resulting models and system with an interdisciplinary group of modelers and head and neck oncology researchers. The results demonstrate that our system effectively supports clinical and symptom research.}

  abstract={Developing applicable clinical machine learning models is a difficult task when the data includes spatial information, for example, radiation dose distributions across adjacent organs at risk. We describe the co-design of a modeling system, DASS, to support the hybrid human-machine development and validation of predictive models for estimating long-term toxicities related to radiotherapy doses in head and neck cancer patients. Developed in collaboration with domain experts in oncology and data mining, DASS incorporates human-in-the-loop visual steering, spatial data, and explainable AI to augment domain knowledge with automatic data mining. We demonstrate DASS with the development of two practical clinical stratification models and report feedback from domain experts. Finally, we describe the design lessons learned from this collaborative experience.},
